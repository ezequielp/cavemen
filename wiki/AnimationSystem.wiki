= Introduction =

We face the problem of animating a 2D character in a complex space, trying to provide a smooth animation.

The main weakness of our engine is that all images must be rendered in advance.
The main advantage is that we have a 3d model to prerender all needed images, and modern technology to store and display it.

= Requirements =

 * The animation must be induced by a controler (the keyboard, mouse or just a script)
 * The animation must obey the laws of physics. That means it must respect collisions.
 * The animation must be smooth. 
 
= The animation =

Consider the Flying and the Walking animations.

We find the following elements:
 * A frame element: A single image.
 * An escape frame: A frame that allows the transition to another state (in green). It can depend on the destination state.
 * An animation sequence: The set of frames that is played to achieve the animation.


== Coupling to physical engine ==

There is no direct coupling to the physical engine.

== Coupling to the dragon object==
An animation implies a velocity. That doesn't mean the animation sets a velocity on the engine, but it has a field called velocity.

The dragon object is an arbiter between the animation and the physics engine. It tries to set the velocity to the one asked by the dragon object. 
It converts from the dragon's reference frame to the world reference frame.
It is aware of the collisions and informs the animator object if a movement can't be executed.
