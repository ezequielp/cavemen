#summary An event signaling that an object is moving faster than a given threshold velocity.

*Emisor:* The [PhysicMachine Physics engine]

*Receptor:* The map object.

= Example sequence =

 # An object's velocity is faster than 1000 pixels per second. The physics engine posts an event saying so.
 # The map object listens to that event and examines the object position. The object is outside the map's limits.
 # The map object kills the object.
