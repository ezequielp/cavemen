#summary Basic state for a wandering caveman
#labels Phase-Design

= `State_Wandering` =

This state makes a caveman travel through the map using a basic diffusive behavior. The caveman will move from one cliff to the other of its current floor and will decide to travel to a safer ground in a non deterministic way.
 
=== Possible improvements ===

 * Make movement more "human like", i.e. Make the caveman stop to rest, add noise to trajectory (see [http://freespace.virgin.net/hugo.elias/models/m_perlin.htm Perlin noise]).

== Enter behavior ==

When entering to a new floor, it will change the agent's position to the corresponding door and load the left, right cliff positions and the doors.

== Execute behavior ==

Execute will decide one of the following objectives and walk there using a [SteeringBehaviorSeek seek steering]:
 # left cliff
 # right cliff
 # door

It will change to the [StateEnteringDoor entering door state] when arrived at an objective door.
It will change direction and objective when arrived at a cliff.
