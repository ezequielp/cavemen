The caveman will be the main entity of the game, reacting to the player's actions but not being directly commanded by him.

= Features Needed =

 * It stores the floor it is standing on and moves over it with a 1D coordinate
 * All the caveman movements are constrained on the floor
 * It starts in a [StateWandering wandering state] and diffuses [StateUsingDoor through doors].
