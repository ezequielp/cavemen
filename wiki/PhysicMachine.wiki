Physics has been implemented using [http://www.pyweek.org/d/932/ pymunk] python bindings of the [http://wiki.slembcke.net/main/published/Chipmunk  chipmunk physics engine].

This is a very flexible engine that will allow us to implement things like explosions. Hopefully buoyancy will be implemented by the time it's needed.
