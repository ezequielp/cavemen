#summary The physics engine

= Introduction =

This is the physics engine of the game. For the moment (for the sake of simplicity) it is implemented as a Finite State Machine (FSM) that has two possible states, each one representing an approximation to Newtonian physics. For the final version we could need to implement a complete physic engine here (Bullet,Tokamak, Newton, ODE, etc..)
