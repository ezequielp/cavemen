#This is the description of the basic actor class

= `Basic_Actor` =
_Extends `pygame.sprite.Sprite` and `state_machine`_

This class will implement the basic requirements to any entity moving in the game's world. It inherits from pygame's Sprite class and from the [StateMachineClass `state_machine` class] to implement AI.

== Features needed ==

 * Owns a finite state machine using the [StateMachineClass state machine class]. 
 * Implements a physics engine that allows moving the entity in the map by use of the following interface:
   * `set_steering_force()`
   * `turn_gravity_ON()`
   * `turn_gravity_OFF()`
 * Implements the update of the actor's coordinates using the standard Update method, as expected by the parent class Sprite
