#summary An event signaling that a previous request can be processed by the physics engine and will be started once the anim system acknowledges.

*Emisor:* The [PhysicMachine Physics engine]

*Receptor:* The animation engine.

= Example sequence - Motion change =

 # An object A is moving right
 # A message is broadcast by an external object requesting that the object A changes its motion to the left.
 # It emits the event PHYS_CHANGE_READY to signal that the change is possible.
 # If it receives a [EventANIM_CHANGE_READY] it will make the object come to rest.
 # Once it receives the [EventANIM_CHANGE_OK] it changes the object's direction and sends the [EventPHYS_CHANGE_OK]

= Example sequence - Jumping =

 # An object A is standing still
 # A message is broadcast by an external object requesting that the object A jumps.
 # The physics engine emits a PHYS_CHANGE_READY event to signal that the jump is possible.
 # If it receives the [EventANIM_CHANGE_OK] it adds a vertical component to the velocity of the object and sends the [EventPHYS_CHANGE_OK]
