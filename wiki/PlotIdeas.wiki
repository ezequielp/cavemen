#summary Ideas for the background story of the game

= Introduction =

Here some ideas about the background story of the game will be described. The point is to create a background for the game to motivate playing and give some initial points for story-making.

= The story =

_Dragons were know to be creatures of enormous wisdom. But this was not true from the beginning of their existence. As all the live beings in this universe they have to learn how to survive._
= =
_ The first dragons were destructive creatures eating everything they can without any constraint. But not after too long they realized that food was scarce and not enough for all of them. They ate all kind of animals and plants, and their hunger lead to the extinction of many species. Some of the oldest dragons realized that their usual behavior was taking them unavoidably to oblivion and they realized something must be done. The dragons were never good at building and they did not like tools but the most rudimentary ones. They can not breed or cultivate their food. They were in loved with the hunting and freedom. The situation looked really bad. The animals they ate where so unintelligent and easy to hunt that all the possible measures to be taken implied effort to the dragons, and the younger ones did not appreciate rules over they feeding behavior. Organization of the hunt was not a feasible solutions as the things were on those ages._
= = 
_Once, the dragons from the wide-lands described an animal that was particularly difficult to hunt and that showed to be keen on adapting to the hunting behavior of the young dragons. This animals were a possible solution for the desperate situations the old dragons envisioned. An animal that can survive an reproduce under the constant hostilities of the dragons represented an infinite source of food._
_Ancient Dragons from all the lands were sent to observed this particular animals and they all concluded these creatures were what the Dragons had been waiting for all this ages._
_The plan was set up. Task groups from all lands should go and hunt the creatures in such a way that these animals decide to emigrate to other places on the world. It took lots of year but finally groups of this creatures departed from the main crowd and starting they journey to more peaceful lands. The groups of dragons sent to achieve this goal were called shepherds and their were committed to their flocks. Their work was to assure the flock to grow, reproduce in a place and when the population was big enough create a new exodus._
= =
_Food was spreading all around the world and a new era of prosperity was begining..._

= What we can do with this? =

I think these idea is a good one to start. Basically the player is one of these shepherds and he/she has to eat from their flock, but also must take care of the survival and reproduction. The tool of the player is the interaction with the flock through hunting and terror but eventually more complex kind of interaction could appear.
The animals are humans and they will evolve and get more and more intelligent and will try to get rid of the dragon (or adore it, or any solution you can imagine). 
The Dragons world could be very complex and given that they have a clan organization (or something like that, they are intelligent but wild animals, they do not like social systems). We can have attacking dragons, we can have territories to cross with the flock. We can have others predators appart from the dragons...etc...etc..
