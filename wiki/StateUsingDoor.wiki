= `State_Using_Door`=

This is an intermediate state used when entering a door. The basic behavior is switching to a new [StateWandering wandering state] determined by the door's destination, but more complex behavior can be programmed.

This state could be created using a factory method in the door class.

== Possible improvement ==

 * Cave Doors where the caveman can be safe
 * Time to travel through the door

== Enter behavior ==

Maybe an animation where the door is opened if not already and the caveman enters

== Execute behavior ==

The agent is put in a "inside door" state. Then it changes to a wandering state outside the other door.

== Exit behavior ==

Maybe an animation where the door is opened if not already and the caveman exits
